# Project Desert Tortoise - TelemetryExplorer
Explore the telemetry gathered from the NOAA spacecraft! 

TODO:

[ ] Finish all of the instrument sumaries and breakdowns

[ ] Find a library to allow for ephemeris queries so that a map can be constructued and plots can be overlayed onto for things like HIRS images and auroral estimators

[ ] Find a way to color code the hex frames without it taking a billion years because insertHTML() in QT is so freakin' slow.

[ ] Everything

[ ] Everything Always

[ ] Everything Else, Sometimes
